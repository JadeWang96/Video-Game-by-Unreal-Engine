# Video-Game-by-Unreal-Engine

## Project Description
This project contains 3 simple video game implementations by Unreal Engine 4.22 Gameplay framwork and C++.
- Triple X(Warm-up)
- Bulls and Cows Game(Warm-up)
- Escape(For real)
- Battle Tank(For real)

I built the 3D user interface in Unreal Engine software and generated the project framework from software automatically.I don't write all the things by myself :)

I wrote the game logic and implemented the specific game with the existing game component/actor template and environment.

There many unreal engine special data structures and types were utilized in the projects, which are totally different from general C++ library and focus on the game.

### Bulls and Cows Game
This is the word version of game.

- A person (Host) thinks of any isogram word, and gives out the number of letters in the word.
- Other players (Guessers) try to figure that word by guessing isogram words containing the same number of letters.
- Host responds with the number of Cows & Bulls for each guessed word. As with the digit version, "Cow" means a letter in the wrong position, while "Bull" means a letter in the right position.


### Escape Game
A 3D secret room for the escape game.
