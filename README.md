:blush: :smiley: :relaxed: :laughing: :smile:
## Project Description
This project contains 3 simple video game implementations by Unreal Engine 4.22 Gameplay framwork and C++.
- Triple X(Warm-up)
- Bulls and Cows Game(Warm-up)
- Escape(For real)
- Battle Tank(For real)

I built the 3D user interface in Unreal Engine software and generated the project framework from software **automatically**.

:warning: :warning: :warning:

**I didn't write all the things by myself :)** I wrote the game logic and implemented the specific game with the existing game component/actor template and environment.
(See the source files for each game)

There many [unreal engine](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Introduction/index.html) special data structures and types were utilized in the projects, which are totally different from general C++ library and focus on the game.

It is painful for me to design a 3D game since I feel sick whenever I played a video game.

### Bulls and Cows Game
This is the word version of game.

- A person (Host) thinks of any isogram word, and gives out the number of letters in the word.
- Other players (Guessers) try to figure that word by guessing isogram words containing the same number of letters.
- Host responds with the number of Cows & Bulls for each guessed word. As with the digit version, "Cow" means a letter in the wrong position, while "Bull" means a letter in the right position.


### Escape Game
A 3D secret room for the escape game.
